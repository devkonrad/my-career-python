## How to run? Docker Compose
In the 'app' folder we have a simple list registration application written using Flask (python), Jinja as a framework and using VueJs (Javascript) on the frontend. We just need to run these commands at the project root folder

```sh
docker-compose build #build the containers
docker-compose up -d #run the containers
```
It will up the following services:
- ``db:`` A Postgres Database will be available at the http://localhost:54321 
- ``api:`` A Fastapi instance will be available at the http://localhost:5100/jobs 
- ``app:`` A Flask App (With VueJS Frontend) instance will be available at the http://localhost:5200
- ``admin:`` A PGAdmin (Python/Postgres) instance will be available at the http://localhost:5300

## Continuos Integration/Delivery (CD/CI)
